## 📝 Overview

This project investigates the evolution of credit spreads between High Yield (HY) and Investment Grade (IG) corporate bonds in the context of US presidential elections. Contrary to the common belief that elections universally increase market risk, our findings suggest that spreads—particularly for HY bonds—tend to narrow following elections, presenting a potentially profitable trading opportunity.

## 📊 Methodology

- **Indices Used**:  
  - IG: LUACTRUU Index  
  - HY: LHVLTREU Index  
- **Approach**:  
  We analyzed HY-IG spreads across six U.S. elections over the past 24 years, focusing on the 3 months before and after each election.
- **Key Metric**:  
  Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) difference between HY and IG indices.

## 📈 Findings

- A long-HY / short-IG position would have been profitable in 5 of the last 6 elections.  
- The only exception was 2008, due to the overriding impact of the financial crisis.  
- The strategy appears robust regardless of the winning party (Republican or Democrat).  
- Volatility tends to decrease after elections, especially for HY bonds.

## 📌 Conclusion

A systematic election-based spread strategy (long HY, short IG) has historically generated positive returns, supporting the idea of a post-election "risk-on" environment in credit markets.
